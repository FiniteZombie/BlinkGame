# BlinkGame
v0.0.1
This is the first playable of Blink! Right now it’s just testing out the idea of an action game entirely centered around a teleport mechanic (think Nightcrawler: The Game).

How this is intended to be played:
Combat is a little Batman/Spider-Man like in that you don’t need to be adjacent to a dude to hit them, if you’re close enough you’ll automatically blink over and punch them. Enemies don’t do anything right now, so just pretend there are goons shooting at you occasionally or coming up to you and throwing punches, encouraging you to switch targets often.

Controls:
Gamepad (this description assumes xbox, but any gamepad should work):
	Blink Jump: A
	Blink Evade: B/Right Trigger
	Attack: X/Right Bumper

Mouse/Keyboard:
	Blink Jump: Space
	Blink Evade: Right Click/Shift
	Attack: Left Click

Known Issues:
- There’s currently no way to reset or exit the game, so Alt F4 / Cmd Q are gonna be your friends
- Spamming attack and jump lets you jump forever
- Spamming jump makes each jump higher
- Fall can be slowed by spamming the Blink button
